## General Info

After sitting at the island at my parent's house, I came to the realization that I wanted something physically warmer for our island edge. Using a computer at the island results in cold forearms after a short time, as the stone pulls the heat from your arms.

This was the solution I came up with, a cherry slab with the concrete countertop poured against the live edge. This would give us the insulating properties of wood, the visual interest of a live edge slab, and the smooth (kid-safe) outside edge of a thick piece of clean-cut solid wood.

One slab wasn't sufficient to cover the length we needed, so two slabs were combined with a large scarf joint.
